[Msgdrop](https://msgdrop.io) - Test Email, Webhooks and 2FA!

Msgdrop is a RESTful API built for efficient Email, Webhook, and two-factor authentication (2FA/MFA) testing.

Things you can do:

- Disposable email addresses from an API
- Accessing an inbox through an API
- Webhook URLs for testing
- Enrol and generate 2FA codes from an API

Msgdrop is designed to be a simple, fast, and reliable one-stop solution for automation testing disjointed user journeys in an innovative way.
